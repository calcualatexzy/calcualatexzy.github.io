I'm a final year undergraduate student at Zhejiang University.   

I major in Robotics Engineering, under the Chu Kochen Honors College & School of Control Science and Engineering.
<br/>

Previously, I was a research intern at [FAST Lab FAR](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/fei-gao/) advised by [Prof. Fei Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4RObDv0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and I finished my summer research at Carnegie Mellon University [SafeAI Lab](https://safeai-lab.github.io) supervised by [Prof. Ding Zhao](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/zhao-ding.html) where I worked closely with [Haohong Lin](https://hhlin.info/) and [Shiqi Liu](https://shiqiliu-67.github.io/).
