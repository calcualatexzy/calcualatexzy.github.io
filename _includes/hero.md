# Ziyi Xu 许子绎

I am an incoming Master’s student in Robotics at EPFL. I completed my undergraduate studies in Robotics Engineering at Zhejiang University, under the Chu Kochen Honors College and the School of Control Science and Engineering.

Previously, I was a research intern at the [FAST Lab FAR](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/fei-gao/) advised by [Prof. Fei Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4RObDv0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I also conducted summer research at Carnegie Mellon University’s [SafeAI Lab](https://safeai-lab.github.io), supervised by [Prof. Ding Zhao](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/zhao-ding.html), where I worked closely with [Haohong Lin](https://hhlin.info/) and [Shiqi Liu](https://shiqiliu-67.github.io/). In addition, I completed my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Prof. Qiuguo Zhu.
