    <h3>Query as You Need: Query-centric Diffusion Policy for Generalizable Robotic Assembly</h3>
    <p><em><strong>Ziyi Xu</strong>*, Haohong Lin*, Shiqi Liu*, and Ding Zhao</em></p>
    <p>Developed a two-stage hierarchical framework with a query-centric diffusion policy for zero-shot execution of long-horizon assembly tasks in robot manipulation, using task-relevant queries to guide the policy. </p>

### LEMON-Mapping: Loop-Enhanced Large-Scale Multi-Session Point Cloud Merging and Optimization for Globally Consistent Mapping 
*Lijie Wang, Xiaoyi Zhong, **Ziyi Xu**, Kaixin Chai, Anke Zhao, Tianyu Zhao, Changjian Jiang, Qianhao Wang, Fei Gao*  

A scalable multi-session point cloud map merging and optimization framework is designed, which integrates two-step PGO with spatial BA. 

***In submission to T-RO**, 2025.* &nbsp;  [\[Paper\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10018)

### Preserving Relative Localization of FoV-Limited Drone Swarm via Active Mutual Observation 
*Lianjie Guo\*, Zaitian Gongye\*, **Ziyi Xu**, Yingjian Wang, Xin Zhou, Jinni Zhou, and Fei Gao*  

To balance the demands for FoV-limited swarms by acquiring environment observation as well as mutual observations with a safety guarantee, this paper proposes an active localization correction system, which plans camera orientations via a yaw planner during the flight.

### FACT: Fast and Active Coordinate Initialization for Vision-based Drone Swarms
*Yuan Li\*, Anke Zhao\*, Yingjian Wang\*, **Ziyi Xu**, Xin Zhou, Jinni Zhou, Chao Xu, and Fei Gao*  

Our paper proposes a complete system to recover a swarm’s initial relative pose on platforms with size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints.

### ◦ Reinforcement Learning for Ladder-Climbing Quadrupeds

*(Advised by Prof. Qiuguo Zhu)*

Designed and integrated a custom hook-based foot mechanism to enhance stability during vertical traversal. Developed a reinforcement learning framework enabling quadruped robots (Lite3) to climb various ladder configurations.

### Real-time 3D Point Cloud Object Detection Model Based on Auto-wheeled Robot Platform

*National Student Research Training Program (SRTP) - **Ziyi Xu**, Zifei Wu, Zhe Yang*  

We self-designed and developed a real-time object tracking autonomous car from scratch, implemented and compared state-of-the-art 3D-point-cloud-based object detection methods.

### Reinforcement Learning for UAV Trajectory Tracking

*Course Project: Innovation and Practice in Robotics - **Ziyi Xu**, Lijie Wang, Liang Wang*  

We generated a high-quality trajectory library and used PPO to train diverse trajectory tracking. The model was deployed in the real world using domain randomization.
