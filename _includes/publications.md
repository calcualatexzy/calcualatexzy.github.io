### Preserving Relative Localization of FoV-Limited Drone Swarm via Active Mutual Observation 
*Lianjie Guo\*, Zaitian Gongye\*, **Ziyi Xu**, Yingjian Wang, Xin Zhou, Jinni Zhou, and Fei Gao*  

To balance the demands for FoV-limited swarms by acquiring environment observation as well as mutual observations with a safety guarantee, this paper proposes an active localization correction system, which plans camera orientations via a yaw planner during the flight.

### FACT: Fast and Active Coordinate Initialization for Vision-based Drone Swarms
*Yuan Li\*, Anke Zhao\*, Yingjian Wang\*, **Ziyi Xu**, Xin Zhou, Jinni Zhou, Chao Xu, and Fei Gao*  

Our paper proposes a complete system to recover a swarm’s initial relative pose on platforms with size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints.

### Real-time 3D Point Cloud Object Detection Model Based on Auto-wheeled Robot Platform

*National Student Research Training Program (SRTP) - **Ziyi Xu**, Zifei Wu, Zhe Yang*  

We self-designed and developed a real-time object tracking autonomous car from scratch, implemented and compared state-of-the-art 3D-point-cloud-based object detection methods.

### Reinforcement Learning for UAV Trajectory Tracking

*Course Project: Innovation and Practice in Robotics - **Ziyi Xu**, Lijie Wang, Liang Wang*  

We generated a high-quality trajectory library and used PPO to train diverse trajectory tracking. The model was deployed in the real world using domain randomization.  

*The simulation and real on the left are not the same traj*ectory.
